# Algorithm Analysis Group-Project
CS4306/01 â€“ Algorithm Analysis Fall 2019 Group Project. Menelio Alvarez, Krystal Hines, and Spencer Kolwaite

# Project Summary
  The purpose of this project was to show the strength and weaknesses of A* search Algorithm in finding the shortest path through a weighted graph. To highlight its strengths and weaknesses we compared it to an Exhaustive search algorithm. The following graphs show how our A* search algorithm performed nest to an Exhaustive search algorithm:

The code in this repository showcase a demo of our A* search Algorithm finding the shortest routes between nodes on the following road map:
