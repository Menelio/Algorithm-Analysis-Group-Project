CS4306/01 â€“ Algorithm Analysis Fall 2019 Group Project. Menelio Alvarez, Krystal Hines, and Spencer Kolwaite

# Project Summary
  The purpose of this project was to show the strength and weaknesses of A* search Algorithm in finding the shortest path through a wiegthed graph. To highlight its strengths and weaknesses we compared it to an Exhuastive search algorithm. The following graphs show how our A* search algorithm preformed nest to an Exhuastive search algorithm:
